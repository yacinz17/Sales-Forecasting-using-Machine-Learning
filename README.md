# Sales Forecasting using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to forecast future sales based on historical sales data.  
It uses regression techniques to capture trends and seasonality, enabling data-driven business decisions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering (lag features, date-based features).
- Model training using **Random Forest Regressor**.
- Evaluation with **RMSE** and **RÂ² Score**.
- Synthetic dataset generation for demo if no real data is provided.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (optional for visualization)

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
